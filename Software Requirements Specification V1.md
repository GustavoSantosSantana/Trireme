## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Project Objectives  
Define the primary goals of the software being developed and set clear expectations for what the system aims to achieve.

### 1.2 Project Scope  
Define the boundaries of the project, including what is included and excluded.

### 1.3 Project Overview  
Describe the project's goals, the steps to achieve these goals, and the expected outcomes. Outline the project schedule, necessary resources, and status.

---

## 2. Project Description

### 2.1 Project Features / Functions  
List at least 3 main features and functionalities to be developed.

### 2.2 User Stories  
Simple, concise description of a feature or requirement from the perspective of an end user. User stories are often used in Agile development methodologies to capture user needs and facilitate communication between stakeholders. List at least 3 user story statements to briefly describe the type of user, what they want and why.

1. As a `<type of user>`, I want `<some goal>` so that `<some benefits>`.  
2. As a `<type of user>`, I want `<some goal>` so that `<some benefits>`.  
3. As a `<type of user>`, I want `<some goal>` so that `<some benefits>`.

### 2.3 Use Cases  
Describes a specific interaction between a user (or "actor") and the application to achieve a particular goal. It outlines the steps involved in this interaction and can help to clarify functional requirements. List at least 3 user cases to describe a set of interactions between a system and one or more actors.

1. **Use Case 1** (either Use Case Diagram or Use Case Specification)  
2. **Use Case 2** (either Use Case Diagram or Use Case Specification)  
3. **Use Case 3** (either Use Case Diagram or Use Case Specification)

### 2.4 Project Assumptions and Dependencies  
Outlines the factors that are assumed to be true for the project and the external elements that the project depends on. These assumptions and dependencies help manage risks by identifying potential challenges or factors that could impact the projectâ€™s success.

---

## 3. Project Collaboration and Documentation  
Specify what collaboration and documentation tools/platforms that will be used in this project development and how your group will use these tools/platforms.

---

## 4. Project Management  
Specify what project management methods and tools will be used in this project development and how your group will use these methods and tools.
